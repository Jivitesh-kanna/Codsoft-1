Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills in web development and design. I've built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've also added a theme customization feature using JavaScript to make it unique and personalized.

## Features

- **Home:** The landing page provides a brief introduction about me.
- **Portfolio:** This section highlights some of my projects, including descriptions and links.
- **About:** Learn more about my background, skills, and interests.
- **Contact:** You can get in touch with me through the contact form provided.

## Theme Customization

I've added a theme customization feature using JavaScript, allowing you to personalize the website's appearance. You can change the color scheme, fonts, and other visual elements to your liking.
